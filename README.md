# HomeNetSecUpgrade

## What is this?
I am documenting the deployment of best practices and upgrades aimed at enhancing security and privacy in home networks!

## Why?
Often, we set up our internet service and don't give it a second thought. But what if you want to harden your home network? This project is about delving deeper into the workings of your home network, ensuring true privacy, and safeguarding against ISPs potentially selling your data. Your home network should be under your control, and it's crucial to be knowledgeable and in command of what's happening within it.
